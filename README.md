# Company Documents Store

Sample .Net 5 Blazor Server web application that relies on Entity Framework for its ORM, SQL Server File Table to store documentation, and uses the Open Id Connect protocol to connect with Azure AD and provide both external and internal users with secure single sign on and protect resources with policy based authorisation. As a single page application it offers a fast and user friendly UI, designed to make accessing and managing documentation as simple and secure as possible.
